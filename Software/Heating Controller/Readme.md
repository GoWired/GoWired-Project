This is a heating controller which is designed to control heating valves on the basis of readings from external thermometers. 
It can work with up to 8 sections. It is possible to set individual daytime temperature for every section. 
Nighttime, holiday time temperatures and hysteresis value are set for the whole module.

There are two operating methods:
- autonomous - in which the software switches outputs automatically, on the basis of comparing temperature readings with set points (it is only necessary to switch modes - day/night/holiday by an external controller)
- dependent - in which it is possible to switch outputs fron an external controller

Both methods can be switched during the controller's operation.
